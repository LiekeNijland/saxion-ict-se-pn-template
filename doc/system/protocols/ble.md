## BLE protocol specification

**TEMPLATE** This document should describe the protocol as is used between the Laird LoRaWAN device and its controlling node (smartphone or computer). This protocol is to be built on top of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Compatibility is *not* a requirement here, though it would be nice to have as it would enable a British smartphone to be used with a Laird device running American software, for instance.
